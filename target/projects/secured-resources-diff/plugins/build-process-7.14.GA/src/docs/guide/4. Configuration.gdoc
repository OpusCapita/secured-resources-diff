This is very easy to add and configure build process plugin in any grails artifact. All you need is put a plugin reference into your plugin's section of BuildConfig.groovy:
{code}
plugins {
    build('com.jcatalog.grailsplugins:build-process:<version>') {
        excludes 'release'
    }

    ...

}
{code}
